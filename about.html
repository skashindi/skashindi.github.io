				     <p> This page is about me. let me tell you a bit about myself.</p>
					 <p> I love computers and making things with them. I started learning about coding when I was in school 
					     and it quickly became something I was really excited about.</p>
					 <p>My dream is to use technology to make life easier and better. I'm always up for a challenge and love learning new things.</p>
					 
					 
				  <h3>My Background</h3>
				     <p>I've always been interested in technology, especially coding. Even when I was young, I liked figuring out how gadgets worked.
					    This interest led me to learn more about computers and coding.</p>
				     <p>Through my education, I've learned many programming languages and gained a good understanding of computer science.

				  <h3>My Hobbies</h3>
				      <p>I love soccer! I've been playing it since I was little. It's so much fun and keeps me active and healthy.</p>
					  <p>During weekends, I'm usually on the field, playing with my team. It's not just a game; it's about teamwork and working together.</p>
					  <p>When I'm not playing soccer or working with tech, I like to read, paint, and go for walks in nature. These things help me relax
					     and get new ideas.</p>
					  <p> Whether I'm scoring goals on the fields or painting a picture, I'm happy and passionate about both soccer and tech.</p>
